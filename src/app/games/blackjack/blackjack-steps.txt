After user hits play....

1. Get the card deck

2. Shuffle the deck

3. Establish players (get info)

4. Get player.bet from user (cannot be more than the available money they have)

5. Deal two cards to the user and two cards to the dealer (with one face down)... gather weights of all cards
    a. Check to see if blackjack or user has blackjack
    b. Check to see user has two of the same card -> (then we can offer the split option to user if available)

6. Get user input (hit, stay, split...)
    a. If stay, flip over dealer card and compare weighted values
    b. If hit, give another card to the user, and repeat step 5 in total
    c. If split, give the user two hands and go from there (discuss with Shawn)

7. Check to see who won by the weights of the cards
    a. Get dealers weights
    b. Get users weights (for all hands if they split)

8. If user won, give them their money by adding to their money total. If dealer won, take
money by subtracting the users money total of the player.bet

9. End game, offer to play again


Questions:
  1. Ask Shawn how to grab user info. If we login and set the player info to something in another module... how do we get that info?
  2. Best way to shuffle cards? (Zack, look up randomizer functions for JS)
  3. Ask Shawn about split method
  4. How to display components in the best way? Use *ngIf and *ngFor?
